            <P>
                This is a project for MET CS601. In this portfolio you will learn more information about me. I'll  
                try to apply what I have learned in this course, and demonstrate my own thoughts and understanding 
                into the design of this project. While this project may still need refinement, I appreciate your 
                interest in my portfolio. I hope you get a general idea of the skills I have. 
            </P>

        <!-- About Me -->
        <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>
                My name is Yucheng Guan and I currently live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingzhou">Jingzhou</a>, China. 
                I'm pursuing my master's degree at Boston University, and my major is Computer Information System 
                with a Web Development concentration. Programming has always been my weakness, but I have a unique 
                interest in web technologies. Based on continuous learning, I'm more inclined to transit to the 
                web product manager in the future.
            </P>
